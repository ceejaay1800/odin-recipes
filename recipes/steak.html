    <center><p><strong>Description:</strong></p></center>
    <center><p> This 20-minute recipe is done on the stovetop in one pan (no need to finish it in the oven). This is one of my favorite steak recipes and I make it year-round because it’s such a quick and convenient cooking method. That garlic butter is lip-smacking good! Read on for great tips on how to improve beef sustainability, reduce food waste and you will love my ideas for easy meal prep with leftover steak.</p></center>
        <p><strong>Ingredients:</strong>
            <ul>
                <li>New York Steak</li>
                <li>Salt</li>
                <li>Black Pepper</li>
                <li>Butter</li>
                <li>Garlic</li>
                <li>Rosemary</li>
            </ul>
   <p><strong>Steps:</strong>
        <p>
            <ul>
     <li><strong>Step 1:</strong> Pat dry, use paper towels to pat the steaks dry to get a perfect sear and reduce oil splatter.</li>
                <li><strong>Step 2:</strong> Season generously,just before cooking steaks, sprinkle both sides liberally with salt and pepper.</li>
                <li><strong>Step 3:</strong> Preheat the pan on medium and brush with oil. Using just 1/2 Tbsp oil reduces splatter.</li>
                <li><strong>Step 4:</strong> Sear steaks – add steaks and sear each side 3-4 minutes until a brown crust has formed then use tongs to turn steaks on their sides and sear edges (1 min per edge).</li>
                <li><strong>Step 5:</strong> Add butter and aromatics – melt in butter with quartered garlic cloves and rosemary sprigs. Tilt pan to spoon garlic butter over steaks and cook to your desired doneness, </li>
                <li><strong>Step 6:</strong> Remove steak and rest 10 minutes before slicing against the grain.</li>
            </ul>
